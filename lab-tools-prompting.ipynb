Returns result in standard form for real-world application clarity. Includes handling edge cases like 0 raised to any positive or negative power and infinities as necessary outputs.\n",
      "add(first_number: int, second_number: int) -> complex - Add two integers together using precise arithmetic representation (complex numbers format). Ensures that the result is given in standard form for real-world application clarity when dealing with large sums where precision matters significantly.\n",
      "log(value: float) -> str - Calculate and return a string describing the natural logarithm of an input number, including handling special cases such as inputs less than or equal to zero (returns 'undefined' in these instances). Also includes pre-calculation caching for efficiency when dealing with repeated calculations involving common numbers.\n",
      "sin(degrees: float) -> str - Calculate and return the sine value of an angle provided in degrees, ensuring that it handles inputs as strings representing valid angles (e.g., '45°') or numeric values where appropriate; also includes trigonometric periodicity considerations for practical applications involving repeating cycles within a given time frame.\n",
      "calculate_area(radius: float) -> str - Calculate the area of a circle based on input radius and returns result in standard form, including handling special cases such as non-positive radii (returns 'undefined' if less than or equal to zero). Also takes into account precision limits for extremely large circles.\n",
      "compose_music(pattern: List[str], duration: float) -> str - Generate a simple melody line using the provided note pattern and rhythm, where notes are represented as strings ('C', 'D', 'E', etc.) with corresponding octave numbers (1 to 4); durations can vary from quarter-notes down to sixteenth-notes. The tool includes transposition capabilities for standard tuning intervals in music theory applications when requested by the user and adjusts melody lengths according to provided duration values, offering a creative yet systematic approach to basic song composition with customizable playback speed (tempo).\n",
      "convert_currency(amount: float, from_rate: str) -> dict - Convert an amount of money in one currency to another using exchange rates and time-sensitive data feeds for realism; includes error handling for non-numeric inputs or unsupported currencies. Outputs a dictionary containing the converted 'original_currency', 'target_currency', 'converted_amount' keys, with values properly formatted as strings representing monetary amounts rounded to two decimal places and accounting for floating exchange rates that may fluctuate within seconds in real-world applications (e.g., using API data).\n",
      "parse_csv(filepath: str) -> pd.DataFrame - Read a CSV file from the given path, parse its contents into an organized pandas DataFrame object with labeled columns; includes handling empty files or non-CSV formats gracefully by returning 'None'. Also adds functionality to specify selected rows via indices if needed for data sampling purposes in real applications where only certain subsets of large datasets are required.\n",
      "analyze_sentiment(text: str) -> dict - Perform sentiment analysis on input text and returns a dictionary with keys 'positive', 'negative', and 'neutral' representing respective score percentages; also includes context-aware enhancements for idiomatic expressions, sarcasm detection within social media content to improve realism in the results.\n",
      "detect_language(text: str) -> str - Identifies the language of a given input text string using natural language processing techniques with high accuracy and returns it as 'en', 'es', etc., or indicates if unclear/mixed languages are present; also includes fallback to user-provided locale settings when ambiguous content leads to uncertain detection outcomes.\n",
      "generate_graph(data: List[Tuple[str, float]], title: str) -> matplotlib - Create a bar chart using the provided data list and assigns it with given 'title'; ensures compatibility across different operating systems by utilizing cross-platform compatible libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn; includes customization options for colors representing distinct categories in dataset as well as adding plot labels, titles, axis limits to enhance interpretability within realistic business reporting scenarios.\n",
      "create_email(subject: str, body: str, recipient: str) -> str - Construct an email draft with the provided subject line and body text; simulates Gmail's interface for composing emails that includes a dynamic 'to', 'cc', 'bcc' field setup based on input or defaults when omitted. Results in string representation of complete HTML-formatted email content ready to be sent through an SMTP server, with additional functionality such as embedding images directly into the body text and handling multi-recipient scenarios effectively for personalized marketing communications within realistic professional environments.\n",
